                Inventory Type #1: Raw Materials
              </p>
              <p class="article-content">
                Raw material inventory pertains to the items stored and utilized in a manufacturer’s process to design and construct its products. These types of inventory are eventually combined or manipulated to develop a completely new item. They’re like the ingredients need to bring all finished goods to their final state. Many times, raw materials are only managed by manufacturers. However, it’s not uncommon for retail-oriented businesses to either handle their own raw materials or at least have a hand in the raw material selection and distribution process.

                The rubber and cotton used to make shoes is considered raw material. Think of the bits and pieces, often in raw form, that come together to create a product. Another example would be the glue and sheet glass used by window manufacturers, or the raw tobacco plant that goes into a cigar.

                Just like its name, work-in-progress (WIP) inventory is just that, an item that’s currently in the process of being made. WIP inventory items aren’t only reserved for physical materials, but rather they occasionally include some overhead costs and labor, along with the raw materials we talked about in the previous point. The WIP inventory is not yet ready for sale.

                    As mentioned, a WIP inventory item depends on the industry. If you run a hair salon, shampoo would be considered a WIP inventory, as it’s part of the path towards the finished hair style. A clothing item that’s sitting at the end of the assembly line is also a WIP item, seeing as how it’s most likely waiting to be inspected or packaged.

                  A finished good is ready to be sent to a customer, whether that’s a business or consumer. In the supply chain, these finished goods are considered completed, usually after an inspection and some sort of packaging. Overall, you consider inventory part of the finished goods category when it’s ready to be marketed and sold.

Those are finished goods. Even completed plates that are served to customers are finished goods. For retail, a blouse hanging from a curtain is a finished good. From a manufacturing perspective, a piece of furniture being loaded onto a truck is a finished good. In short, it’s common for all types of businesses to have finished goods as inventory.</p>
