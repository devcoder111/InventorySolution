                QR codes and barcodes are used on a regular basis to track and
                manage logistical operations, especially for traditional retail
                and eCommerce. These codes have become the norm for inventory
                management because all you have to do is get an inventory
                barcode scanner. An inventory barcode scanner offers the
                convenience of scanning items from any smartphone device, and it
                logs every type of inventory and all steps of your inventory
                movement process.
              </p>
              <p class="article-content">
                Not only does an inventory barcode save you money by eliminating
                pricey scanning equipment (just use a phone or tablet!) but the
                app syncs to all other devices. You can see reports and clear
                inventory updates. Understand which items need to be restocked
                and perform cycle counts so that you have information about each
                item at the click of a button.

                In this article, we’ll explain exactly how an inventory barcode
                scanner works and how it can become your best friend for
                inventory management.

                Getting Started With An Inventory Barcode Scanner
              </p>
              <p class="article-content">
                The first step is to figure out if you have the right platforms
                and devices. Luckily, inventory barcode scanners like Britecheck
                function on all smartphones and tablets. There’s no reason to go
                out and buy an expensive barcode scanner since most devices you
                currently own have the features available for barcode and QR
                code scanning. This applies to both Apple and Android devices.
              </p>
              <p class="article-content">
                Simply download an inventory barcode scanner, like Britecheck,
                to your phone or tablet. After that, it’s ready to go. The
                scanner is offered as a standard mobile phone app, so you can
                save it on your homescreen and have direct access to it at all
                times. Not to mention, there’s no need to worry about any
                incompatibilities with browsers, since it’s possible to open
                your Britecheck account in any browser.

              <p class="article-content">
                What’s great is that many eCommerce platforms and website
                building plugins provide the management and printing tools you
                need to generate barcodes to place on your products. Utilizing
                the inventory scanner only takes a few clicks.

                Open Britecheck, your inventory barcode scanner app. Britecheck
                uses your device’s camera hardware, so it’s not much different
                than taking a picture. However, the picture-taking functionality
                is used inside the app. Therefore, you would select that you’d

                By default, iPhones and Androids detect QR codes and attempt to
                open up the stored data in your phone. When using an inventory
                barcode scanner like Britecheck, the same thing happens, except
                that barcode data is logged into the app.

                Tell Britecheck if you’d like to add a specific quantity or

                the item with its barcode information. After that, you’ll have
                direct access to each of those inventory items in your
                Britecheck dashboard, accessible through the app or on a
                computer interface.

                Android devices are already configured to scan QR codes, so

                You’ve successfully scanned a code and stored that item of

                offers a myriad of settings to configure with each scan. For
                instance, you can begin by setting the inventory quantity for
                that item. There are quick buttons for increasing and decreasing
                the quantities or directly editing them from your device.
