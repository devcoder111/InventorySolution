              Maintaining optimum inventory levels has long been a headache for healthcare practitioners. However, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the situation has never been as bad as it is today. The high demand for healthcare compounded with crumbling supply chains has left many hospitals struggling to manage inventory.

                iBuildApp is a super simple platform for mobile app creation, hosting, and management. Its template for inventory management apps is all you need to create a robust inventory and asset tracking solution for your hospital. With an iBuildApp-based application, you can track stock details like quantity, location, condition, usage, and price with much less effort.
              </p>
              <p
                class="article-content"
              >
                The iBuildApp IM template leverages the power of spreadsheet formulas and references and the intuitiveness of a smartphone interface.
              </p>
              <p class="article-content">
                You can create your hospital IM app right off the bat by logging in to iBuildApp, selecting a template from the library, and adding the inventory module. The platform will show you all the options available for configuring your app’s interface.
              </p>
              <p class="article-content">
                To integrate the app with your inventory data, you need to link it to a spreadsheet file, preferably a Google Sheet. Select the right file, and find the worksheet you want to upload to iBuildApp.
              </p>
              <p class="article-content">
                Once your inventory file is imported, iBuildApp populates the app automatically. You can view and maintain the information in your master file right from the app’s dashboard, or export data into a separate Google Sheet to perform your analysis from there.
              </p>
              <p class="article-content">
                You can also search for items by keyword, or filter them by name, category or date. Moreover, every item is assigned a barcode that you can scan to get information in a snap. Meanwhile, the platform allows you to add as many extra details as you want, including imagery.
