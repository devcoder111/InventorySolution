                            <br><br>

                            If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be for any reason unenforceable, then
                            that provision shall be deemed severable from the other provisions herein, and shall not
                            affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Britecheck shall have no
                            liability under these Terms of Use to the extent arising from any failure of Britecheck to
                            perform any of its obligations due to any fire, flood, earthquakes, other acts of God, war,
                            civil unrest, terrorism, Internet failures, governmental act or court order, national
                            emergency, strikes or labor disputes or any other event not within Britecheck ’s reasonable
                            control.
                            <br><br>

                            The failure of Britecheck to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of
                            Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service
                            constitutes the entire agreement between you and Britecheck and govern your use of the
                            Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Britecheck (including, but not
                            limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).
