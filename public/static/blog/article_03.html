                            When it comes to inventory, one word sums it all up: complicated.
                            And all businesses, from clothing retailers to auto part manufacturers,
                            handle different types of inventory through the entire production process.
                            Therefore, it’s essential to understand the types of inventory
                            involved in order to run your business effectively and know which stage each inventory item
                            falls under.

                            Although there are close to a dozen inventory types, five main ones are held by the vast
                            majority of businesses.
                            This includes raw materials, work-in-progress inventory, finished goods, MRO, and service
                            inventory.

                        <h3>Inventory Type #1: Raw Materials</h3>
                        <p>
                            Raw material inventory pertains to the items stored and utilized in a manufacturer’s process
                            to design and construct its products.
                            These types of inventory are eventually combined or manipulated to develop a completely new
                            item.
                            They’re like the ingredients need to bring all finished goods to their final state. Many
                            times, raw materials are only managed by manufacturers.
                            However, it’s not uncommon for retail-oriented businesses to
                            either handle their own raw materials or at least have a hand in the raw material selection
                            and distribution process.
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <h4>A Raw Material Example</h4>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
                                <img src="/static/src/images/articles/raw_material_1.png" alt=""
                                    class="article-img, article-raw-material" />
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
                                <img src="/static/src/images/articles/raw_material_2.png" alt=""

                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                            The rubber and cotton used to make shoes is considered raw material. Think of the bits and
                            pieces, often in raw form,
                            that come together to create a product.
                            Another example would be the glue and sheet glass used by window manufacturers, or the raw
                            tobacco plant that goes into a cigar.
                            <br><br>

                        <h3>Inventory Type #2: Work-in-progress inventory</h3>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-4 col-12">
                                <p>
                                    Just like its name, work-in-progress (WIP) inventory is just that, an item that’s
                                    currently in the process of being made.
                                    WIP inventory items aren’t only reserved for physical materials, but rather they
                                    occasionally include some overhead costs and labor,
                                    along with the raw materials we talked about in the previous point. The WIP
                                    inventory is not yet ready for sale.
                                    <br><br>

                            It’s still going through modifications and additions.
                            WIP inventory varies depending on the industry, but in general, it involves all materials in
                            that production process.

                        <h4>A Work-in-progress Inventory Example</h4>
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-7 col-12">

                                    As mentioned, a WIP inventory item depends on the industry. If you run a hair salon,
                                    shampoo would be considered a WIP inventory,
                                    as it’s part of the path towards the finished hair style.
                                    A clothing item that’s sitting at the end of the assembly line is also a WIP item,
                                    seeing as how it’s most likely waiting to be inspected or packaged.
                                    <br><br>
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>Inventory Type #3: Finished Goods</h3>
                        <img src="/static/src/images/articles/inventory_type_3.png" alt="" class="article-img" />
                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                            A finished good is ready to be sent to a customer, whether that’s a business or consumer.
                            In the supply chain, these finished goods are considered completed, usually after an
                            inspection and some sort of packaging.
                            Overall, you consider inventory part of the finished goods category when it’s ready to be
                            marketed and sold.
                            <br><br>

                        <br><br>

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-5 col-12">
                                <p>
                                    A restaurant spends quite a bit of time in the WIP arena, but it’s not uncommon to
                                    see prepackaged food items at the register, such as cookies or cakes.
                                    Those are finished goods. Even completed plates that are served to customers are
                                    finished goods.
                                    For retail, a blouse hanging from a curtain is a finished good.
                                    From a manufacturing perspective, a piece of furniture being loaded onto a truck is
                                    a finished good.
                                    In short, it’s common for all types of businesses to have finished goods as
                                    inventory.

                        <h3>Inventory Type #4: MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operating Supplies) Inventory</h3>
                        <p>
                            MRO stands for maintenance, repair, and operating supplies. Sometimes called overhaul
                            inventory,
                            MRO items involve the inventory used to put together the product, not including the pieces
                            that actually end up in the finished product.
                            Support and maintenance tools fall into this category, as do materials that work to
                            strengthen, shine, or adjust the products.
                        </p>

                                    This is a broad area of inventory, but storage shelves, shoe buffers, and sewing
                                    machines all fall into the category.
                                    Protective gear, such as gloves and masks come into play as MRO inventory as well.
                                    You might even place office supplies and computers under the MRO umbrella.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Service inventory is similar to MRO inventory, except it’s the human form of what
                                    goes into the final product.
                                    The production process doesn’t only work with machines and materials,
                                    so it’s important to think about the logistics of those people working on the
                                    assembly line.

                        <h4>A Service Inventory Example</h4>
                        <p>
                            Employees are the primary example of service inventory. But it goes further than that.
                            Actually managing this type of inventory is more about understanding schedules and skills.
                            This way, you’re able to make your logistics run smoothly.
                        </p>
