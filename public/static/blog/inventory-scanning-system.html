                            All companies with physical products have to worry about inventory management. Sometimes
                            that means you’re counting inventory by hand and writing it down on a pad of paper. Other
                            times you incorporate a barcode inventory system to ensure that you’re getting the right
                            numbers and logging all products in your inventory collection. Overall, an efficient
                            inventory scanning system is key to running a productive and profitable business. It allows
                            you to understand how your inventory moves and brings in information for making better
                            stocking and ordering choices in the future.
                            <br><br>
                            But that begs the question: what’s the point of an inventory scanning system? What are the
                            benefits and downsides? Is it really making you that efficient in the long run? The answer
                            to that last question is a resounding yes, seeing as how an inventory scanning system
                            combines hardware like an inventory scanner and QR codes to automate the entire process of
                            logging your products.
                            <br><br>
                            In this article, we’ll explore this key question, uncovering the true benefits of an
                            inventory scanning system and showing you exactly how your company can benefit from the
                            automation.

                        <h3>To Efficiently Manage Inventory</h3>

                        <img src="/static/src/images/articles/img-post-1503-1.jpg" alt="article image"
                            class="article-img" />
                        <br><br>

                        <p>
                            The movement of physical inventory benefits from an inventory scanning system due to its
                            perpetually growing nature and the fact that it’s nearly impossible to keep track of all
                            units by hand.
                            <br><br>

                            There are far too many moving parts within a growing ecommerce or retail business, so it
                            makes sense to bring in an efficient inventory management tool to log it all for you.
                            <br><br>

                            In short, you’re making an attempt to improve the way you track and maintain your inventory.
                            This way, you can check in on which items are sent to which warehouses, while also gaining a
                            better understanding of which products are selling better in certain regions.
                            <br><br>

                            And it all starts with an inventory scanner. Britecheck offers a quick inventory scanner
                            that works as long as you have a phone or tablet with you. A physical hardware scanner works
                            as well, as long as it’s constantly functioning and isn’t a pain for your employees to carry
                            around.
                        </p>

                        <h3>To Improve How You Use Your Inventory</h3>

                        <img src="/static/src/images/articles/img-post-1503-2.jpg" alt="article image"
                            class="article-img" />
                        <br><br>

                        <p>
                            An inventory scanning system enables you to see a clear picture of which products are
                            selling well. It compiles the absolute facts and gives you an idea of which inventory to
                            reorder and potentially market to more customers. Think about it. Overall, having a log of
                            your inventory opens up possibilities for selling more products. You may be able to see that
                            one item sells rather well in the northeast region of the US. However, it doesn’t perform
                            quite as well in the south.
                            <br><br>

                            With that type of information, you’re equipped to spend more resources on certain products
                            and cut the fat when needed. After all, there’s no need to keep stocking items that simply
                            sit on the shelf and provide no sales for your company. On the other hand, you want to
                            identify the top sellers and ensure that your resources go towards either making more of
                            those or looking for items that are similar or can complement it.
                        </p>

                        <h3>To Improve Where You Move the Inventory</h3>

                        <img src="/static/src/images/articles/img-post-1503-3.jpg" alt="article image"
                            class="article-img" />
                        <br><br>

                        <p>
                            Your inventory gets sent all over the world, so you should utilize an inventory scanning
                            system to boost your chances of sending them to the right places. With fulfillment centers,
                            you’re making an educated guess about where to send and store your products.
                            <br><br>

                            However, as time passes, and you keep a better eye on your inventory movement, you’re able
                            to narrow in on the right ways to store your inventory. As an example, you may find that one
                            product should have 1,000 units stored in a warehouse on the west coast, while you only need
                            100 of them sent to a warehouse in the Midwest.
                            <br><br>

                            That not only cuts down on the shipping time to your customers, but it most likely shrinks
                            the costs for storing unnecessary inventory in the wrong places.
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            To Cut Unnecessary Costs
                        </h3>

                        <img src="/static/src/images/articles/img-post-1503-4.jpg" alt="article image"
                            class="article-img" />
                        <br><br>

                        <p>
                            Tying into the previous point, a barcode inventory system does a wonderful job of trimming
                            costs. It does this in several ways, like showing you exactly where to store your inventory
                            after sales are made, and also by expediting the entire process of logging inventory by
                            hand.
                            <br><br>

                            Smaller companies may manually track inventory, but it doesn’t take long to realize this is
                            an inefficient and overwhelming method. An inventory barcode system automates much of the
                            process, and it makes you more organized by logging the SKUs and product codes within your
                            system for further management.
                            <br><br>

                            So, the cost -savings are two-fold: You learn how to efficiently move your products and
                            focus on producing the ones that sell the best. In addition, you’re opening up time for you
                            and your employees to spend on other parts of the business.
                        </p>

                            In general, it makes little sense to spend time with data-entry when logging inventory. It
                            takes too long to do it manually, it’s demoralized work as an entrepreneur, and there’s no
                            way you’re being as accurate as an automated inventory scanning system.
                            <br><br>

                            Think about all the other tasks you could pursue if you were to simply cut out the manual
                            process of logging inventory. You can spend more time on marketing, accounting, product
                            development, or sourcing. Seeing as how an inventory scanner does all the inventory
                            management for you, the previous suggestions are all better uses of your time.

                            Overall, an inventory scanning, or barcode inventory system, makes your life easier as a
                            business owner. It provides the potential for more sales, and it cuts costs that you didn’t
