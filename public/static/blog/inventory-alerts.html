                            Staying on top of inventory is crucial for businesses of all sizes. More often than not,
                            inventory holds the most significant value among the current assets in a balance sheet.
                            Therefore, proper inventory management gives a business the best chance to thrive. By
                            striking a healthy balance between the inventory coming in and going out, a business can
                            effectively control the costs of non-capitalized assets and achieve optimal profitability.

                        <p>
                            For many businesses, however, managing inventory is easier said than done. According to
                            research, <a href="https://blog.capterra.com/inventory-management-statistics/"
                                target="_blank" title="blog.capterra.com">46% of all small and medium-sized
                                enterprises</a> do not know how to keep track of stock inventory or use manual methods.
                            The good news is that inventory management tools exist to help you streamline your
                            stock-keeping processes. With the right software, you can gain insight into all aspects of
                            your inventory and take proactive measures to optimize your entire supply chain.

                        <h2>The Value of Inventory Alerts</h2>

                        <p>
                            Inventory management solutions come with several notable features. One of the most critical
                            functions is the ability to deliver inventory alerts. These alerts give you real-time
                            information about changes in your inventory level.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many businesses configure low-stock alerts to prevent stockouts, but an inventory app can
                            also notify you about new orders, upcoming shipments, and slow-moving stock. Comprehensive
                            mobile-based solutions like Britecheck can also keep an eye on your inventory reorder points
                            and inform you when and how much you need to order.
                            <br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h2>Leveraging Stock Alerts for Effective Inventory Management</h2>

                        <p>
                            Inventory alerts can be delivered as emails or push-notifications to your team or specific
                            staff members in real-time. Below are four ways you can use these alerts to improve your
                            business.
                        </p>

                            1. Maintain control of your supply network
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Inventory stockouts are a costly issue for businesses. Studies show that companies lose <a

                            situations. Even more intriguing is that <a

                                25% of Amazonâ€™s retail revenue</a> comes from buyers who tried to purchase items in
                            other stores, but they were out of stock.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Inventory alerts help you avoid this problem by keeping you on top of your stock levels at
                            all times. They also save you the time and effort of manually tracking impactful inventory
                            movements. Additionally, if you manage multiple selling channels, a back in stock alert app
                            can notify you when new stock items are delivered to your warehouse. That way, you can
                            ensure your stores always have enough inventory to fulfill orders when they come.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Experts recommend configuring low-stock alerts whose thresholds give enough safety stock for
                            current and new orders. Set higher thresholds for popular, fast-selling items to avoid
                            crisis situations and expensive rush shipping. If frequent ordering is too expensive, you
                            can negotiate better pricing with key suppliers for bulk orders.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            2. Respond better to demand fluctuations
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Todayâ€™s enterprises operate in an environment of high competition and low consumer loyalty.
                            Buyers across all sectors have many options in availability, quality, and price, which puts
                            them in the driverâ€™s seat. As a small business owner, you must empower your company to make
                            timely responses to demand volatility. If you do not, without question, your competitors
                            will.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Inventory alerts can give you a reliable, real-time view of your productâ€™s performance in
                            the market. Frequent low-stock alerts for particular items can be a reliable indication that
                            your marketing strategies are working, and demand is increasing. On the other hand, alerts
                            for slow-moving items could mean it is time to change your approach or run a promotion.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Whether positive or negative, frequent updates about inventory movements can help you to
                            implement timely measures to align your supply with demand. That way, you can increase your
                            customer service, enhance your margins, and achieve more predictable revenue across your
                            entire value chain.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            3. Optimize your working capital
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Holding inventory means tying down the capital you could be using elsewhere. You have to
                            store it, insure it, and suffer various logistical headaches to use it. Furthermore, holding
                            more than the optimum amount of inventory poses significant business risks. By storing too
                            much inventory, you risk losses should the market take a dive. You also open yourself up to
                            potential write-offs down the road.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Keeping inventory at a minimum must be among your key business goals. A suitable inventory
                            tracking app lets you configure inventory alerts to inform you precisely when and how much
                            you need to order, based on parameters like current orders and supplier lead-times. These
                            alerts can keep you from ordering more than you need and reduce the chances of accumulating
                            unused inventory.

                            Inventory alerts can also tell you immediately a stock item goes beyond a preset threshold.
                            That way, you can respond quickly with steps to return inventory to proper levels and keep
                            your capital fluid.

                            Implementing solutions to reduce manual work and errors can save your business a great deal
                            of money. One inventory error can attract costs like paying for more staff hours and
                            emergency shipping arrangements. Your enterprise can also suffer from unhappy customers and
                            loss of market share.

                            An inventory app can be a simple and effective way to automate your stock tracking process.
                            Britecheck, for example, features barcoding, which replaces paper-based, error-prone
                            stocktaking. Adding alerts to the mix gives you a convenient tool that delivers reliable
                            information about your inventory whenever you need it. With error-free reporting, you can
                            increase your warehouseâ€™s efficiency, reduce labor costs, and keep your customers happy.
