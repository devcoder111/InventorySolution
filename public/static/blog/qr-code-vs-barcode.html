                            Inventory management involves having a code attached to each product, where you scan that
                            code and the product information gets logged into an inventory management software. This
                            process provides a myriad of benefits, including improved product tracking, a better view of
                            your sales, and efficiency when it comes to moving your products. Overall, this process of
                            tracking your inventory all starts with the code itself. In the past, barcodes were the only
                            options for scanning products into inventory - that, or counting the products by hand and
                            logging them in a notepad or software manually.
                            <br><br>
                            oday, the QR code has gained prominence because of its flexibility, support on mobile
                            devices, and ability to scan horizontally and vertically. Since both barcodes and QR codes
                            are both commonly used in inventory tracking, we want to compare both, bringing light to the
                            QR code vs barcode debate.

                        <h3>The Basics: QR Code vs Barcode</h3>

                        <p>
                            Let’s start with QR codes. Short for “quick response” codes, QR codes change the way regular
                            scannable codes work by offering multi-dimensional scanning. In short, that means that you
                            can walk up to a QR code and try to scan it without having to worry about whether it’s
                            situated horizontally or vertically; the QR code should scan regardless of the orientation.
                        </p>

                        <img src="/static/src/images/articles/img-post-0303-2.jpg" alt="article image"
                            class="article-img" />
                        <br><br>

                        <p>
                            The QR code was invented in 1994, but gained more prevalence as smartphones became popular
                            and high-speed scanning was provided as an option within the functionality of those phones.
                            Overall, device manufacturers began including QR code scanning as one of the features for
                            phone cameras. You’ll also find QR code scanners and generators within many other types of
                            phone apps.
                            <br><br>

                            A QR code usually looks like a square, but it can be modified to appear like other shapes.
                            They are generated by the combination of smaller black and white squares and other shapes,
                            compiling the necessary information within the shapes.
                            <br><br>

                            QR codes differ from barcodes in physicality because barcodes consist of longer black lines
                            and white spaces.
                            <br><br>

                            A QR code inventory management system works when someone with a QR scanner (likely a phone
                            or tablet) scans the code to pull up information about a product and log it into a specific
                            software. QR codes are also commonly used to share social media information, specific
                            websites, or any online data that can be logged within the code.
                            <br><br>

                            Barcodes, as mentioned, have long black and white lines, typically running vertically. Those
                            lines tend to create somewhat of a square shape, and they offer one-dimensional scanning,
                            meaning that you must make the scan close to perfect in order to pull the data from the
                            barcode.
                        </p>

                            class="article-img" />
                        <br><br>

                        <p>
                            Portable scanner hardware can read both QR codes and barcodes. Some barcodes are supported
                            by mobile devices as well.
                            <br><br>

                            In general, a barcode typically stores data like a product SKU and price, as we have
                            traditionally used the barcodes in retail and inventory management. You can find them on
                            just about every type of product, from items at the grocery store to books at the library.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Our QR Code vs Barcode Comparison</h3>

                        <p>
                            QR codes and barcodes have plenty of similarities and differences, so we want to compare the
                            two and show the pros and cons of both. Keep reading to get a taste of why barcodes or QR
                            codes might be right for your inventory management.

                                Here are the major advantages of QR codes:
                            </b>
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You can scan QR codes from any angle and from any orientation. This means that you can
                                turn
                                a code vertically or horizontally and still render the same data in your system.</li>
                            <li>QR codes store far more data than traditional barcodes. QR codes log over 2,500 numeric
                                characters and over 1,500 alpha-numeric characters. Barcodes, on the other hand, max out
                                at
                                around 25 characters.</li>
                            <li>QR codes help with storing valuable inventory data like website URLS, product SKUs,
                                pricing,
                                and plain text information.</li>
                            <li>QR codes have improved security over barcodes since it encrypts all information within a
                                barcode.</li>
                            <li>The vast majority of mobile devices can scan QR codes. There are also plenty of hardware
                                scanners that support QR codes.</li>

                            <li>Depending on the printing, QR codes can be prone to smudging, tearing, or distortion.
                                When
                                that happens, it’s difficult, or impossible, to scan them.</li>
                            <li>You may find that some older hardware scanners lack support for QR codes.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li> Barcodes are the old standard for inventory management, so it’s easy to train employees
                                on
                                how to use them, you can find them everywhere, and you’re likely to locate reputable
                                hardware scanners for your barcodes.</li>
                            <li>Traditional barcodes are cheap and easy to print, so they can often be the most
                                affordable
                                option.</li>
                            <li>They beat out manual logging systems by a long shot, since they provide a more automated
                                process and remove most human error.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You must scan barcodes from the right angle. They’re not as multi-dimensional as QR
                                codes.</li>
                            <li>Barcodes aren’t as secure as QR codes if you plan on storing valuable information. They
                                lack
                                the powerful encryption that QR codes provide.</li>
                            <li>Barcodes don’t store nearly as much data as QR codes.</li>
                            <li>You may find that some mobile devices have better support for QR codes than they do
                                traditional barcodes.</li>
                        </ul>

                            QR code vs Barcode: Which is Best for Your Business?
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Overall, the world is trending more towards QR codes for inventory management. They’re more
                            secure, easier to use, and most devices scan the codes. However, barcodes don’t seem to be
                            going anywhere because of their simplicity and affordability. Therefore, you should expect
                            to use both in your inventory management process.
