              Maintaining optimum inventory levels has long been a headache
              for healthcare practitioners. However, because of the ongoing
              COVID-19 pandemic, the situation has never been as bad as it is
              today. The high demand for healthcare compounded with crumbling
              supply chains has left many hospitals struggling to manage
              inventory.
              <br /><br />

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-4 col-12">
                <p>
                  Fortunately, intuitive, user-friendly mobile solutions exist
                  to relieve this headache. With <b>iBuildApp</b>, you can
                  build your own mobile-based stock management platform in a
                  few short steps <br /><br />
                </p>

              <a href="#">iBuildApp’s template</a> for mobile inventory
              management apps is designed to simplify your warehousing
              processes by placing all visibility and control on your palm.
              Therefore, you can stop worrying about inventory issues and
              start focusing on what matters: the well-being of your patients.
            </p>
            <h3>
              How does the iBuildApp Inventory Management (IM) App Template
              Work?
            </h3>
            <p>
              <a href="#">iBuildApp</a> is a super simple platform for mobile
              app creation, hosting, and management. Its template for
              inventory management apps is all you need to create a robust
              inventory and asset tracking solution for your hospital. With an
              iBuildApp-based application, you can track stock details like
              quantity, location, condition, usage, and price with much less
              effort. <br /><br />
              The iBuildApp IM template leverages the power of spreadsheet
              formulas and references and the intuitiveness of a smartphone
              interface.
              <br /><br />
              You can create your hospital IM app right off the bat by logging
              in to iBuildApp, selecting a template from the library, and
              adding the inventory module. The platform will show you all the
              options available for configuring your app’s interface.
              <br /><br />
              To integrate the app with your inventory data, you need to link
              it to a spreadsheet file, preferably a Google Sheet. Select the
              right file, and find the worksheet you want to upload to
              iBuildApp.
              <br /><br />
              Once your inventory file is imported, iBuildApp populates the
              app automatically. You can view and maintain the information in
              your master file right from the app’s dashboard, or export data
              into a separate Google Sheet to perform your analysis from
              there.
              <br /><br />
              You can also search for items by keyword, or filter them by
              name, category or date. Moreover, every item is assigned a
              barcode that you can scan to get information in a snap.
              Meanwhile, the platform allows you to add as many extra details
              as you want, including imagery.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Why does your Hospital need an iBuildApp Inventory Management
              (IM) App?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Building an IM app with iBuildApp can enable you to streamline
              key inventory management processes for your hospital.
            </p>
            <h4>● A straightforward and intuitive interface</h4>
            <p>
              Do you often have to comb through complicated spreadsheets and
              notes for information about what you have in stock? You can wave
              those troubles goodbye, with an iBuildApp-based inventory app.
              <br /><br />
              The iBuildApp inventory management template takes all the
              information from a spreadsheet and puts it in a simple mobile
              environment. You can view information about your stock right
              from your mobile device. So, rather than accessing bulky
              spreadsheets directly, you can view information about your stock
              right from your mobile device. Within seconds, you can know what
              you have and make snappy and accurate stock-related decisions.
            </p>
            <h4>● Folders to represent storage locations</h4>
            <p>
              You probably have a myriad of places you can store things in
              your hospital or medical office. But do you have a structured
              way of managing these locations?
              <br /><br />
              In many healthcare centers, staff members waste a lot of
              precious time and money searching for inventory. With an
              <a href="#">iBuildApp inventory template</a>, you can make an
              app that represents storage locations as folders and columns,
              and know what they have right from your mobile device. You can
              also “slice” these columns to filter only the items you want to
              see. <br /><br />
            </p>
            <h4>● On-demand access to inventory data</h4>
            <p>
              With the iBuildApp inventory template, you can create an app
              that uses Ms. Excel files or Google Sheets as databases to give
              you on-demand access to your stock. Therefore, you can view
              essential information about a material, such as the quantity in
              stock, its usage trend, how long it can last, and when to
              reorder in a few easy steps.
              <br /><br />
              An iBuildApp-based inventory app can be a valuable tool for
              managing your ordering plan. By offering a clear,
              easily-accessible picture of what you have and how you are using
              it, the app can help you streamline your ordering so that you
              only order what you need and when you need it.
              <br /><br />
            </p>
            <h4>
              ● Push Notifications about inventory shortages and expiries
            </h4>
            <p>
              The implications of improper stock ordering in healthcare are
              far-reaching. An oversupply could mean losses down the road. On
              the other hand, an undersupply could spell utter disaster. In
              the wake of the Coronavirus, hospitals have had to scramble for
              suppliers that they had overstocked just last year.
              <br /><br />
              Deploying a mobile app for inventory management means leveraging
              one of the most significant strengths of the smartphone:
              <b>push notifications</b>. These alerts ensure that nothing
              passes unchecked. <br /><br />
              The iBuildApp platform allows you to configure your new app to
              deliver push notifications about the status of your critical
              items. That way you can stay on top of both stockouts and
              expiries, and make the right decisions at the right time.
            </p>
            <h4>
              ● Spreadsheet formulas and barcode scanning for automated data
              input
            </h4>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-8 col-12">

              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4 col-12">
                <p>
                  Many hospitals order an array of items that look and sound
                  similar but are very different. Therefore, ordering and
                  managing inventory using your eyes, memory, and manual tools
                  can be very problematic. In healthcare, one error can be all
                  it takes for you to shut down.
                  <br /><br />
                  Building an app with the iBuildApp inventory template
                  enables you to use formulas to calculate output using data
                  from one or multiple spreadsheets.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              Furthermore, you can add a barcode function and configure the
              app to use your smartphone’s camera as a scanner for existing
              barcodes on your inventory. With both spreadsheet formulas and
              barcodes, you can automate the way you collect and manage stock
              data.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h4>Your move ...</h4>
            <p>
              Now that you understand how the iBuildApp platform for app
              creation works and how it can help you refine your inventory
              processes,

              With an iBuildApp inventory app, you can start spending less

              healthcare.
