                            Many large companies prefer specialist inventory software like SAP and Syspro, but these
                            packages can be costly and complicated for smaller enterprises. Excel is a relatively
                            affordable and versatile alternative to specialized systems. It offers a practical way to
                            digitize records and calculate stock levels accurately, minimizing waste, stockpiles, and
                            shortages, and enhancing cash flow.

                        </p>

                        <img src="/static/src/images/articles/br-img-post-1.jpg" alt="article image"
                            class="article-img" />
                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                            That said, Excel can take significant time and practice to master. If you are a novice user,
                            you can find it tricky to create a spreadsheet-based inventorying tool from scratch.
                            Thankfully, Excel templates exist to take the burden off your shoulders. With pre-written
                            formulas and ready-made sheets, an inventory management Excel template gives you a framework
                            for building a stock-keeping solution. All you need to do is populate the rows and columns,
                            and Excel will do the rest.
                            <br><br>
                            Furthermore, if you have an Excel-compatible inventory app like <a
                                href="https://britecheck.com/" target="_blank"
                                title="https://britecheck.com/">Britecheck</a>, you can use it to input data into your
                            Excel template quickly and effortlessly. That way, you can leave Excel working entirely
                            autonomously in the background.

                        <h3>Choosing the best inventory management Excel template for your business</h3>

                        <p>
                            Because of the popularity of Excel in stock keeping, the internet is packed with inventory
                            spreadsheet templates. However, not all templates can suit your business. Understanding the
                            makings of a proper inventorying template will help you find the one that best works for
                            you.
                            <br><br>
                            Below are the top aspects to consider when looking for your next inventory management Excel
                            template.
                        </p>

                        <h4>1. Speed and simplicity</h4>
                        <p>
                            The primary purpose of an Excel template is to simplify your inventorying. So, the last
                            thing you want is a slow, cumbersome platform. Whatever you save by accurately managing
                            inventory will be wasted on training your team and paying for mistakes. A proper inventory
                            management Excel template gives you all the tracking features you need in a clear, concise
                            way.
                        </p>

                        <h4>2. Flexibility and scalability</h4>
                        <p>
                            Inventory is among the most dynamic aspects of a business. Managing it effectively requires
                            an easily malleable tool to adapt to changes in factors like sales, strategy, material
                            availability, and supplier performance.
                            <br><br>
                            So, choose a template that allows for quick adjustments without having to restructure
                            everything. A flexible template enables you to remain agile to month-to-month fluctuations
                            and maintain control at all times.
                        </p>

                        <h4>3. Analysis and forecasting</h4>
                        <p>
                            Tracking inventory goes beyond counting your supplies. A larger part of this process is
                            analyzing stock trends to make accurate forecasts of future purchases, item usage, and
                            product sales.
                            <br><br>
                            Therefore, go for a template with built-in formulas and functions to analyze current and
                            historical data and use it to make demand and supply predictions. Accurate forecasts enable
                            you to make more informed inventory decisions that cater to your short-term and long-term
                            needs.
                        </p>

                            <br><br>
                            This free inventory management Excel template from Indzara delivers a specialized stock
                            tracking platform for small manufacturing businesses. You can use this template to view
                            current raw material stocks and calculate how many finished products you can make with the
                            materials available.
                            Indzara’s inventorying template features five Excel sheets: Home, Products, Raw Materials,
                            BOM (Bill of Materials), and Orders.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>● Home</b> acts as the introductory sheet. It features brief instructions on how to use
                            the other tabs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>● Products</b> lists all your finished products and the quantities ordered, as derived
                            from the Orders tab.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>● Raw Materials</b> lists the raw materials you use, the starting inventory, and each
                            item’s reorder point. It also retrieves the units purchased from the Orders tab and uses the
                            BOM tab to calculate the raw material units remaining after the finished products ordered
                            are produced.
                            For good measure, the template compares the units remaining and your reorder point and tells
                            you whether you need to reorder.

                        <p>
                            <b>● BOM</b> outlines the bill of materials for making your finished products. It shows you
                            the raw materials you have currently and calculates the finished products the raw materials
                            can make.

                            Indzara’s excel inventory template offers commendable functionality in one simple package.
                            It ensures you never miss to deliver customer orders because of raw material shortages. It
                            also monitors your purchases and keeps them within your reorder points for optimum stock
                            levels.
                            <br><br>

                            Like Zervant’s template, Indzara works well with inventory management apps like Britecheck.
                            You can use an app to feed details like product names and available raw materials quickly.

                        <p>
                            This template is specific to businesses that store products and raw materials in warehouse
                            bins. Bins typically vary in size and location. With this template, you can know precisely
                            which section an item is located and its quantity for quicker stock-level analysis and
                            optimized warehouse layouts.
                            Office.com’s warehousing excel template has three tabs: Inventory List, Inventory Pick List,
                            and Bin Lookup.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>● Inventory</b> List tracks item availability in different bins and locations. It sums up
                            the quantities in the bins and provides the total stock per item and its value. You can also
                            set reorder levels, and the template will tell you whether or not an item needs reordering.

                            <b>● Bin Lookup</b> acts as a bin database. It stores essential bin information, such as bin
                            size, location, and bin numbers, making it easier to know where to store particular items.

                            This warehousing template from Office.com offers a straightforward way to track your storage
                            locations. You can know precisely what each bin has and streamline your stock movements.
                            <br><br>
                            A mobile inventory app allows you to capture bin data quicker than with manual entries. You
                            can allocate barcodes to your bins and use an app like Britecheck to record bin information
                            directly to the template.
